## CarouselSS

This is a pure HTML5/CSS3 image carousel. Many tutorials on the internet for image carousels either:
	1. Use an unnecessary amount of javascript
	2. Don't animate the image transitions

I created this repo to make a simple carousel that can be appropriated for various uses. I found a very good post on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/dp_lewis/pen/hqylE) with a javascript free image carousel, and have added some features to allow for it to be integrated in different projects.
